        Use this method to retrieve a
        [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of merchant
        platforms that are linked to your ISV account.  


        **Note**: If you want to view the details of a specific merchant
        platform and you have its merchantPlatformId, use our [Retrieve Merchant
        Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/retrieve)
        method.  


        Our gateway returns the following information about each merchant
        platform in the list:  

        - Legal information, including its legal name and address.  

        - Contact information, including the email address for the business.  

        - Processing  account information, including the processingAccountId and
        status of each processing account that's linked to the merchant
        platform.  


        For each merchant platform, we also return its merchantPlatformId and
        its linked processingAccountIds, which you can use to perform follow-on
        actions.

        Use this method to board a merchant with Payroc.  


        **Note**: This method is part of our Boarding solution. To help you
        understand how this method works with other Boarding methods, go to
        [Board a Merchant](https://docs.payroc.com/guides/integrate/boarding).  


        In the request, include the following information:  

        - Legal information, including its legal name and address.  

        - Contact information, including the email address for the business.  

        - Processing account information, including the pricing model, owners,
        and contacts for the processing account.  


        When you send a successful request, we review the merchant's
        information. After we complete our review and approve the merchant, we
        assign:  

        - **merchantPlatformId** - Unique identifier for the merchant
        platform.  

        - **processingAccountId** - Unique identifier for each processing
        account linked to the merchant platform.  


        You need to keep these to perform follow-on actions, for example, you
        need the processingAccountId to [order
        terminals](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/create-terminal-order)
        for the processing account.

        Use this method to retrieve a
        [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of processing
        accounts linked to a merchant platform.  


        **Note**: If you want to view the details of a specific processing
        account and you have its processingAccountId, use our [Retrieve
        Processing
        Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/retrieve)
        method.  


        Use the query parameters to filter the list of results that we return,
        for example, to search for only closed processing accounts.  


        To list the processing accounts for a merchant platform, you need its
        merchantPlatformId. If you don't have the merchantPlatformId, use our
        [List Merchant
        Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list)
        method to search for the merchant platform.


        Our gateway returns the following information about eahc processing
        account in the list:  

        - Business details, including its status, time zone, and address.  

        - Owners' details, including their contact details.  

        - Funding, pricing, and processing information, including its pricing
        model and funding accounts.  


        For each processing account, we also return its processingAccountId,
        which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

        Use this method to add an additional processing account to a merchant
        platform.  


        To add a processing account to a merchant platform, you need the
        merchantPlatformId. Our gateway returned the merchantPlatformId in the
        response of the [Create Merchant
        Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create)
        method.  


        **Note**: If you don't have the merchantPlatformId, use our [List
        Merchant
        Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list)
        method to search for the merchant platform.  


        In the request, include the following information:  

        - Business details, including its business type, time zone, and
        address.  

        - Owners' details, including their contact details.  

        - Funding, pricing, and processing information, including its pricing
        model and funding accounts.  


        When you send a successful request, we review the information about the
        processing account. After we complete our review and approve the
        processing account, we assign a processingAccountId, which you need to
        perform follow-on actions.  


        **Note**: You can subscribe to our processingAccount.status.changed
        event to get notifications when we update the status of a processing
        account. For more information about how to subscribe to events, go to
        [Events List](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/events/events-list).
