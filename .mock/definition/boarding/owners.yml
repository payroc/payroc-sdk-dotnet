        Use this method to retrieve details about an owner of a processing
        account or an owner associated with a funding recipient.  


        To retrieve an owner, you need their ownerId. Our gateway returned the
        ownerId in the response of the [Create Processing
        Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account)
        method or the [Create Funding Recipient
        Owner](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/funding/funding-recipients/create-owner)
        method.  


        **Note:** If you don't have the ownerId, use the [Retrieve Processing
        Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/retrieve)
        method if you are searching for a processing account owner, or use the
        [List Funding Recipient
        Owners](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/funding/funding-recipients/list-owners)
        method if you are searching for a funding recipient owner.  


        Our gateway returns the following information about an owner:  

        - Name, date of birth, and address.  

        - Contact details, including their email address.  

        - Relationship to the business, including whether they are a control
