        If you have the ownerId, you can use this method to retrieve the details
        of the owner. The response includes the owner's contact details and
        information about the owner's relationship to the business.  


        If you don't have the ownerId, you can use the following methods to
        retrieve the owner's information:
          - **Owners of processing accounts** - Use the HATEOAS links that we send you when you [Retrieve a processing account](/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/get) or [List merchant platform's processing accounts](/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts).
          - **Owners of funding recipients** - Use the [List funding recipient owners](/api/schema/funding/funding-recipients/list-owners) method.
