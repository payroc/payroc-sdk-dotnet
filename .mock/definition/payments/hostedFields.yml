        Use this method to create a Hosted Fields session token. You need to
        generate a new session token each time you load Hosted Fields on a
        webpage.  


        In your request, you need to indicate whether the merchant is using
        Hosted Fields to run a sale, save payment details, or update saved
        payment details.  


        In the response, our gateway returns the session token and the time that
        it expires. You need the session token when you configure the JavaScript
        for Hosted Fields.  


        For more information about adding Hosted Fields to a webpage, go to
        [Hosted
        Fields](https://docs.payroc.com/guides/integrate/hosted-fields).
