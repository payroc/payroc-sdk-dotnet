# Payroc SDK Test Harness

This is a simple console app that executes some preset operations against the UAT environment of the Payroc API. It is designed to be used as a test harness for the Payroc SDK, such that individual features can be debugged against a real environment.

## Setup

Ensure an environment variable called `PAYROC_API_KEY` is set with your UAT API key.
