        Use this method to create a session token that you use to authenticate a
        Hosted Fields session. When you create an instance of Hosted Fields on a
        webpage, include the session token in the config object.  


        For more information about how to set up Hosted Fields, see [Set up
        Hosted
        Fields](https://docs.payroc.com/guides/integrate/hosted-fields/set-up-hosted-fields).  


        **Note:** You need to generate a new session token each time you load
        Hosted Fields on a webpage.
